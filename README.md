# DeobfuscatorTest
This tool is a personal study on obfuscation & de-obfuscation techniques. It is badly implemented and I will work on it only if University leaves me enough time.
Don't ask for help on cracking protections because it is unethical and I'm not going to help. Reverse, learn & study, but don't ruin other people work.
